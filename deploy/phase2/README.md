# Homelab Use Case

One of the primary targets of the Blast cluster is to run Homelab.  Overall goals are:

- **Stability on the network layer:**  Make sure the family can continue to work and play to the best extent possible!  
- **Backup and redundancy:**  Reduce and eliminate any single points of failure
- **Ability to experiment with newer technologies:**  It is a home lab
- **Ability to run older OSes for specific purposes:**  Should be able to spin up as wide a variety of OS architectures as necessary.
